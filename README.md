# MP3-TRK-Player

This will be my 2nd "MP3-player". V1 was good, but I disassembled it once, 
because I needed the USV circuit somewhere else, and I broke the glued shell.

V2 shall become smaller, in a desktop and/or a portable version (not sure yet), 
and easier to build for everyone. V1 was not intended to be a public project.

This is (yet uncleaned) code for the almost bare minimum player with all hardware parts connected
in a working state. Can play the modern audio formats, no tracker based modules yet.
